Overall, this analysis found that the school type, the total number of students in the school, and the schools' per student budget seem to 
	affect test scores. Noteably, the schools with the best performances were charter schools, schools with a small to medium size, 
	and schools with lower spending ranges.
School type is a huge factor: when looking at the percent of students who passed overall, the highest performing schools were all Charter
	schools, and the lowest were all District schools. For reference, the lowest performing Charter school had an overall passing rate
	of 89.23%, while the highest performing District school had an overall passing rate of 54.64%.
The differences in test scores between grades were also calculated, and for both math and reading test scores, grades were surprisingly
	similar between each grade across every school. Test scores generally varied by only one point across every grade, and this remains
	true for nearly every school.
